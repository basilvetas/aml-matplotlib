# Homework 1

All assignments need to be submitted via github classroom, assignment https://classroom.github.com/a/7DmFzjkn

You also need to submit your assignment on gradescope.

Each assignment needs to be a separate subfolder in the repository called ​task1​ and  ​task2​.

Please add a Readme.md to your repository stating your UNI. Please also add links to the output of the travis run for task1.

## Task 0: Recording consent (or non-consent)

With your homework submission, include a signed and dated statement of the following form: "I <name>, UNI <uni> [consent/do not consent] to audio recording made during the lecture to be posted publicly under a CC-0 license. This includes any accidental recordings of my voice.<signature>" This statement is required (even if you do not consent) and your homework will not be graded without it. If you do not consent, please send an email to the instructor stating this at your earliest convenience.

## Task 1: Unit tests

Ensure that all tests that are written as part of this task are run by continuous integration and pass.

**1.1**​ Set up travisci for your repository, running for Python3.6 and Python3.7. You need to enable travis for your repository in the repository settings, then you can check the status at ​https://travis-ci.com/aml-spring-19/​<your_repo_name> after pushing a commit.

You need to add at least a single test to the repository for the tests to run successfully, so don’t worry if the tests fail at this point.

**1.2**​ Write a function "fib" that computes the Fibonacci sequence. Write a unit test that ensures that the fib(2) is 1, that fib(5) is 5 and fib(12) is 144.

**1.3**​ Write a test that reads `​input.txt​` as provided in your repository using pandas. It’s countries population from 1980 to 2010. Test that the number of rows in the data is 225 and the number of columns is 31 (using the country as an index). Given the correct options this file will parse without changes. Write a separate test that tests that the world population according to this table in 2010 is ca. ​7065 million.

## Task 2: Data Visualization and Analysis

The following plots need to be generated by python files within the task2 folder, called `task21.py`, `task22.py` and `task23.py`. Each file should both show the plot and store it as an image file (called `task21.png`, ...). Also include the generated images in your submission. When asking to reproduce the graphs, you are only required to reproduce the essence of the graph. Tick locations and legend locations and specific colors and fonts are not required, but everything needs to be clearly labeled.

**2.1** ​Pick a graph from ​http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations​ and recreate it using matplotlib (you can also use numpy and pandas). The code should include reading the data from the web if possible, otherwise from a text file for csv file (to be included in the repository). Ensure the axes are labeled properly.

**2.2**​ Create a pair-plot of the iris dataset similar to Figure 1-3 in IMLP using only numpy and matplotlib (you can use scikit-learn to load the data with sklearn.datasets.load_iris, you are not allowed to use pandas). Ensure all axes are labeled. The diagonals need to contain histograms, the different species need to be distinguished by color or glyph, and there needs to be a legend for the species.

**2.3**​ Reproduce the graphs on overlapping data from "Fundamentals of Data Visualization" https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/overlapping-points.html that is figures 18.1 to 18.4, using matplotlib as subplots in a single figure. You can find the dataset on the UCI repository here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG

The code should include reading the data from the web if possible, otherwise from a text file for csv file (to be included in the repository).
